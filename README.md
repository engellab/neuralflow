## Installation
Package only: pip install git+https://github.com/engellab/neuralflow

Package with examples: 

    git clone https://github.com/engellab/neuralflow
    cd neuralflow
    pip install .

If you have issues with Cython extension, and want to use precomplied .c instead, open setup.py and change line 7 to USE_CYTHON = 0

## GPU support

If your platform has CUDA-enabled GPU, install cupy package. Then you can use
GPU device for optimization.
Package passes unit tests with cupy-cuda12x==12.2.0
