    "# Converting data into the interspike interval (ISI) format\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use our package, the spike data has to be converted into the ISI format. In this format for each trial the data contains two 1D numpy arrays. The first array contains the ISIs of all of the neurons, starting from the time interval between the trial start and the first spike, and ending with the time interval between the last spike and the trial end. The second array contains the corresponding neuron indices (ids), which are integers that start from 0. End of trial is marked with -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ISI format**: the data is a numpy array of size `(num_trial,2)`, `dtype = np.ndarray`, where `data[i,0]` contains all of the ISIs for trial `i`, and `data[i,0]` contains the corresponding neuronal IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of the ISI format**:  For example, consider the data with only one trial. The 1st neuron (id=0) spike times are `0.12, 0.15, 0.25`. The second neuron (id=1) spike times are `0.05, 0.2`. Trial 0 starts at `t=0`, and ends at `t=0.27`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the ISI format, the first ISI is between the trial start time and the first spike, which is $0.05$, and the first spike was emitted by a neuron with `id=1`. The second ISI is between $t=0.05$ and $t=0.12$, and the second spike was emitted by a neuron with `id=0`. The last ISI is between the last spike `t=0.25` and the trial end time `t=0.27`, and it is marked with `-1`. The data in the ISI format will be an array of size `(1,2)`, where `data_ISI[0,0]=np.array([0.05,0.07,0.03,0.05,0.05,0.02])`, and `data_ISI[0,1]=np.array([1,0,0,1,0,-1])`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In this task you will convert the data from the spike times format to the ISI format**. You will upload the data in the spike format: `spike_data` is a dictionary with two keys: `trial_end_time`, and `spikes`. The first key is a 1D array of length `num_trial` with the recorded trial end times (assume that all trials start from `t=0`), where `num_trial` is the number of trials. The second key is a numpy array of size `(num_neuron,num_trial)`, where each element is a 1D array of spike times for a neuron on a given trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the example above, the data in this format will be: `data_spikes=[{\"trial_end_time\": np.array([0.27]),\"spikes\": np.array([np.array([0.12, 0.15, 0.25]), np.array([0.05, 0.2])])`. "
