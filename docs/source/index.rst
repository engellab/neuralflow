NeuralFlow: modeling neural activity with continuous latent Langevin dynamics
==============================================================================

NeuralFlow is a Python package for modeling neural spiking activity with continuous latent Langevin dynamics. 
The driving force is optimized from data by gradient-descent algorithm directly in the space of continuous functions.
Non-stationary data distribution can be modelled by inferring initial distribution of the latent states and 
noise magnitude from data using absorbing or reflecting boundary conditions. 
Each neuron has its own tuning function f(x) that links neuron's firing rate to
the latent state.

The modeling results can be interpreted within the dynamical system theory.
The package includes optimization functions (ADAM and Gradient-descent), data generation functions for generating 
spike data from a specific Langevin model, and the core modules like spike data, PDE solver, and model. 
Viterbi algorithm for inferring the most probable path in also included.

In addition, we include feature consistency analysis for model selection based on feature consistency between
the models optimized on two data samples.
