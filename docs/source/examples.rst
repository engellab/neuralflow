.. _examples:Examples========Here we provide two examples. The first example generates synthetic data from a double-well potential and uses this data to fit the model potential. It reproduces Figure 3 in the main text [#Genkin2020]_. The second example demonstrates our feature consistency model selection method using fitting results from two independent data samples generated from the same ground-truth model. It reproduces Figure 5 in the main text [#Genkin2020]_. These examples can also be accessed with Jupiter notebook from our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/engellab/neuralflow/>`_... toctree::    :maxdepth: 2        examples/Example1.ipynb    examples/Example2.ipynb        Reference----------..
